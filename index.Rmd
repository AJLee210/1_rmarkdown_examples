## Data Acquisition and Plotting tests

### Data Download


```{r downloader}

q <- readNWISdv(siteNumbers = '06752260',
                parameterCd = '00060',
                startDate = '2017-01-01',
                endDate = '2022-01-01') %>%
  rename(q = 'X_00060_00003')

```



### Static Data Plotter


```{r, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 5}

ggplot(q, aes(x = Date, y = q)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  ylab('Q (cfs)') + 
  ggtitle('Discharge in the Poudre River, Fort Collins')

```


### Interactive Data Plotter 

```{r}

q_xts <- xts(q$q, order.by = q$Date)

dygraph(q_xts, main = "Discharge of Poudre") %>%
  dyOptions(fillGraph = TRUE, fillAlpha = 0.5, drawPoints = TRUE, pointSize = 2) %>%
  dySeries("V1", label = "Discharge(cfs)") %>%
  dyLegend(show = "always", hideOnMouseOut = FALSE)

```


## The charateristics of Poudre River

**The Poudre River has several characteristics as below:**

- The Poudre river tends to decrease its discharge over time. This is probably seemed due to less snow, a major water resource of the Poudre.
  *Is it the impact of climate change?*

- The main fish that inhabits in the Poudre is Brown trout that is non-native fish.

- One of the most fun things to do in Poudre is rafting along the rough rivers in summer. **Have some cool fun this summer**
